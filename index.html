        <p style="font-size: 140%; text-align: justify;">From the moment I arrived on campus, the onboarding experience was so seamless.The friendly staff greeted me warmly and 
        provided all the necessary materials i required. They conducted an orientation session that helped us familiarize more with the campus, their vision 
        and also the program. AkiraChix trainers are exceptional. The first introduction sessions allowed us to learn, interact and actively engage with the 
        them. Their approach was hands-on and interactive making the lectures more enjoyable. AkiraChix trainers are approachable hence making it easy for 
        students to answer and ask questions in class.</p>
